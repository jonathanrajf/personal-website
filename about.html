            <p id="hi2">Finishing high school...</p>
            
            <p id="text1">I am someone interested in all things Tech, and I think my education is proof of that. As an 18-year old just getting out of High School in India, I had the opportunity to follow the crowd and get a degree in CS or IT because that was viewed as the safest option to get a job later on. It was a very attractive option because of my love for Java Programming in my last 2 years of school and the extremely positive feedback from my teachers. But being someone who wants to know a lot about the different facets of today's technology, I decided to study Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE), knowing that a knowledge of hardware would at some point help me when I work with software systems later on. I did enjoy EEE for the most part but I knew that I would be truly happy only if I was coding. So I taught myself C and C++ which was pretty simple considering I had a good knowledge of core Java. </p>
            
            <p id="hi3">...and moving to America</p>
            
            <p id="text2">So after my degree, I decided to switch to Computer Science. I moved out of India to get out of my comfort zone and explore new environments. I took up an M.S Degree at the State University of New York at Buffalo. In the beginning, graduate courses such as Operating Systems and Algorithms were a challenge considering I had not studied a few CS basics which are usually taught at an undergraduate level. Learning the process of Software Design and Development was very interesting, and as part of a team I designed an Automatic Door Opener for the Disabled (http://weopendoors.webs.com). During my 2nd semester, I got an interest in Robotics and decided to take it up as my specialization. I learnt to use Robot Operating System (ROS) libraries and the various facets of Robotics especially localization and mapping. I took up a course on Computer Vision to support my work in Robotics. I taught myself the basics of Python which was required then.</p>
            
            <p id="hi4">Present Day...</p>
            
            <p id="text3">So 2 gruelling Buffalo winters later, here I am, with no work experience as such, but a basic knowledge in multiple fields of Technology. And I haven't stopped there. I taught myself HTML and CSS and this website is the proof of my knowledge of these scripts. I am in the process of learning Javascript and I plan to learn jQuery and Angular JS once I am done. I am also doing training in the field of Big Data, learning Hadoop, Pig and Hive. Being a fresher with no experience, I have the option of choosing a career path, and so I am looking for jobs in various fields of Computer Science and Information Technology, be it Web Development, Product Development, Software Engineering, Big Data Analytics or Robotics.  One thing I do know is that whatever career path I choose, I will do my utmost to excel in my field.</p>
